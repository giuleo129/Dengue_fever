# Dengue Surveillance & Modeling in Latin America

This project explores epidemiological data from 10 Latin American countries (2020–2024) to analyze and predict Dengue outbreaks using statistical and computational methods.

## Objective
Understand trends and risk factors for Dengue incidence and apply predictive modeling to support public health surveillance.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Jupyter Notebooks  
- Statistical modeling & regression  
- Classification models for risk prediction  
- SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) simulation  
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)  
- Reports and dashboards (PDFs)

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Gathered datasets from official sources and prepared them for analysis.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Investigated incidence patterns and potential risk factors.  
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Built regression and classification models to predict risk levels.  
4. **SEIR Simulation**: Modeled disease spread dynamics to understand outbreak potential.  
5. **Reporting**: Generated graphs, charts, and summary reports to document findings.
